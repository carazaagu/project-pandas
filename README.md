# Project Pandas_Carlos Azagra

The main goals from this projects are:
- Getting used to work with pandas
- Clean a (messy) Dataset
- Manipulate a Dataset
- Obtain information from a Dataset
- Create insights from the information obtained

In order to do so, I will follow the next steps:
1. Import Data & Libraries
2. Rows processing
3. Single columns processing
4. Combined columns processing

## Import Data & Libraries
In this module I will be downloading the **attacks.csv** file from the website that has been sourcered in github and I will be moving it in the same repository where this file **data-wrangling.ipynb** is.\
\
It will allow me to read **attacks.csv** file by just indicatinb the current working directory and concatenating a string with the name of the file.
Other libraries such as **pandas**, **datetime**, **re**, **random** or **numpy** will be imported as well in case I can could need them.\
\
In the following modules I will be navigating through the raw data obtained from the file in order to understand the basic information the file is providing, understanding the data, its types, its meaning, its importance or irrelevance

## Rows
In this module I will be deleting useless data:
- Missing values
- Duplicates

## Single Columns
In this module I will clean the data and make some visualizations, column by column.

## Combined columns
In this module I will try to obtain insights from studying different values together.

# Deliveries
I will be delivering a .ipynb file named " Project2_Data cleaning and manipulating_Carlos Azagra.ipynb " where all the code is processed
